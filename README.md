# Carla0.9.10-kitti-data-export
Using Carla to make data set similar to Kitti 3D target detection & semantic segmentation. 

Thanks for liulingfeng123's work:https://github.com/liulingfeng123/Carla0.9.10-kitti-data-export?tab=readme-ov-file

Due to the change of Carla API, this work is aimed at Carla 0.9.10. 

But it works in Carla 0.9.15, either. Just implement muilt_vehicles.py after changing directory.

If you want to visualize your dataset, please visit this link : https://github.com/kms8527/kitti_visualization

You can get the 3D bbox and lidar data of the vehicle in the Kitti coordinate systemã€‚
